## General Info

Applicate is my own job application tracker built with React, NodeJs/Express and MongoDB. Right now as a MVP in _v 1.0 it provides basic features like authentication/authorization, dashboard, own profile, and adding new applications and companies. At the same time I am still improving and adding new features and ideas. This repo contains the frontend of Applicate.
